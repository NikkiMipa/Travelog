Hello. 
We are compiling the storied accounts of a certain traveller here.
Our aim is to provide a point of view through which we can expose humanity's hitherto unrecorded history.
Before we continue I would like to know,
Have you been here before?
<Yes, take me to the latest entry.>
<No, let me start at from the beginning.>

big home button should take you to home page, not landing page.

style.css is for the landing page
style1.css is for everything else

%try reducing padding size to bring list items closer to left margin?
%and see about adjusting the margin size based on the width of the window (will help 4 mobile)

I want there to be two low poly goblets rotating on either side of the screen at all times.
Maybe once I do more chapters I can identify them by the different rotating objects?
So for 1 it would be a cauldron, 2 a church or a hot cross bun, etc. 

Still keeping the .goblets class name tho lol.

AND HAVE THE GOBLETS NAVIGATE YOU TO THE PREV/NEXT PAGE!

Idk what PHP really does yet but,,
What if you have the page load a goblet based on the associated goblet?
Goblets:
Cauldron
Church?
Hot Cross Bun
Shield
Hand (MR)


PHP:
could I make an object for each chapter that includes all the pages in order and other info like
the goblet and summary?
